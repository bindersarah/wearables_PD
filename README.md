# wearables_PD
End of term project for CISC5800 Machine Learning at Fordham University.

## Aims
1. Predict movement state (sit-to-stand, sitting, turn, turn-to-sit, walk) from the Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG) task
2. Predict cohort (control or Parkinson's Disease)

# Key Files
Aim1.ipynb
Executes 2 models to predict movement state across a cohort of control and diagnosed PD participants via grouped-k-fold cross validation:
  1. Lasso Logistic Regression
  2. SVM with a gaussian kernel, with PCA performing dimensionality reduction

Aim2.ipynb
Develops a CNN
